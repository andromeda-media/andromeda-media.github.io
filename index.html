		<h1><u><strong>Movies Worth Watching</strong></u></h1>
		<p>Welcome to this webpage! <br><br>I would like to say that I am a film connoisseur, given 	
		that I digest many media forms and expose myself to an array of genres and topics. From my
		 17 years of movie viewing experience, I would like to recommend some movies that I think 	
		everyone should see!<br><br> Now to get started!</p>
		
		

		<h2><ol> <strong>First, some of <em>my</em> personal favorites... </strong></ol></h2> 
		<h4><li> Scott Pilgrim vs. the World </li></h4>

		<h4><li> The Royal Tennenbaums</li></h4>

		<h4><li> Coraline</li></h4>

		<h2><br><ul>Now, here are three different <em>kinds</em> of movies...</ul></h2>
		<h4><li>Live-Action</li></h4>
		<p>This is the name for movies that are made using real actors, hence the name "Live 
		Action".</p>

		Florence-Pugh-Saoirse-Ronan-Eliza-Scanlen-Little-Women-2019.jpg" height=300 width=400>
		<p>The image above is from the live action film, <em>Little Women</em></p>
		<h4><li>Animated</li></h4>
		<p>This is the name for movies that use animated drawn images, essentially cartoons. With
		 technology today, we can use computers to synthesize animation or CGI however in the past 
		it was made with flip books and hand drawn images.</p>
		<img src= "https://filmdaily.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mike-wazowski-lede-768x416.jpg" height=300 width=400>
		<p>The image above shows one of the best pieces of animated media, <em>Monsters inc.</em></
		p>
		<h4><li>Stop motion</li></h4>
		<p>Stop motion can be done through many medias. For instance, some stop motion films use
		 plastic models, clay models, or even folded paper to serve as roles in the film. The models
		 appear to have fluid motion because the individual pictures of the model at each position 
		are seamlessly pasted together to create a movie scene. </p>

		halloween-movie-649eeb9ddbef5.jpeg" width=500 height=400>
		<p>Above is an image from a classic stop motion film and one of my all time favorites, 
		<em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em><p>
